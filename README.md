This file works for Cisco devices and Extreme Networks VSP and ERS devices.

DISCLAIMER: I was not the original author of this syntax file. I found it on Reddit and modified it so that it works also for Extreme Networks devices.

Installing:

- Hit Windows button and type "Run"
- Type "%appdata%"
- Navigate to VanDyke/Config/Keywords
- If this folder doesn't exist yet, you'll have to create it
- Copy the network.ini file here

- Open up SecureCRT
- Nagivate to settings
- Under Terminal --> Emulation, make sure "Use color scheme" is checked
- Under Terminal --> Appearance, choose "Chalkboard" for the current color scheme. This will ensure the right background color is used.
- Under Terminal --> Appearance, choose Consolas 12pt for font. This is all personal preferance, but I'm including my settings if you want to recreate it exactly.
- Under Terminal --> Keyword Highlighting --> List name choose "network"
- Under Terminal --> Keyword Highlighting --> Advanced, have "color" checked, and "Reverse video" and "Bold" unchecked.  Whole words should be checked for match style.
- Close settings, and click "Options" on top and make sure "Keyword Highlighting" is checked.  
- If you don't see results immediately, try closing whatever session you have open, and restart it.
